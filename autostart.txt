README Robot Startup System Boot
================================

$sudo apt-get install daemontools

create a file /etc/init/svscan.conf

start on runlevel [2345]

expect fork
respawn
exec svscanboot

$sudo mkdir -p /etc/service/mockbot

create a file /etc/service/mockbot/run

#!/bin/bash
export USER=ros
export HOME=/home/$USER
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
exec /opt/ros/indigo/bin/roslaunch mockbot mockbot.launch

Check service

$sudo service svscan status

svscan start/running, process 835

$sudo svstat /etc/service/mockbot

/etc/service/mockbot: up (pid 849) 1443043529 seconds

Now, your ros launchfile will be startet at system boot.

Not perfect as robot_upstart, but it works ;-)


Today: I prefer the usage of systemd services.

create a ros.service file at /etc/systemd/system/ros.service:

[Unit]
Description=Mockbot Mockturtle ROS Startup

[Service]
ExecStart=/opt/ros/prog/MockBot/mockbot/launch/mockbot.launch

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Enable the new service with sysctl and enjoy your robot.
